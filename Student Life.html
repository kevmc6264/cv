    is a unique one, full of promise and excitement and not to be underestimated
    to say the least. My time at LJMU was a positive one and for all the years that
    I attened, I can honestly say that my time came and went in a blink of an eye.
    I met some really great and wonderful people along the way that really helped
    me out amazingly. At the same time, I also met a lot of assholes too but that
    happens wherever you go. All I can say is this, take one day at a time, don't rush
    anything and above all, find the positive in what you are doing and enjoy it
    as much as you can. LJMU is a great university and I really learnt a lot there,
    so much so that I am now considering my PhD</p>

  <p>When I first went about attaining my degree at university, it was at The
    University of Manchester, and there I studied Japanese Language studies.
    After my first year at this university, I was not overly impressed or happy
    by the end of the first year. This was because I saw many students who were
    now my friends dropping out left, right and centre and with some never
    returning to university altogether. Now there are many reasons why students
    drop out of university, but the scale in which I personally witnessed was
    quite shocking, and frankly, I thought this would never happen. At the same
    time, I would also like to say that it would be entirely disingenuous to
    blame students for dropping out, and that it was entirely down to their own failures.
    In my view, in my observation (and good observation is good science), it
    was more likely to relate to the inadequacies of the course content, management
    and teaching.</p>

  <p>As such, I decided to leave by the end of the first completed year, which
    I must say, I was only 1 of 6 out of 75 that did complete the first year.
    Coming up to my second year, I decided to go to Liverpool John
    Moores University to continue studying Japanese. The first
    year or two was great until the course was discontinued down to budget cuts
    (so I was told) which transpired from the Tory/Liberal coalition government
    that was led by Nick Clegg and the other idiot whose name I won't utter, who
    promised many times over that he would never raise tuition fees for which he
    did once he got in to office. Eventually, I was offered to either leave the
    university or finish in a different degree programme.At the time, I became
    very bitter towards LJMU and thought to myself ‘how can they do this to me.’
    Anyway, I met a great young guy called Thomas from the student union who
    told me that there were a third option which was to sue the university which
    I went about, however, the university quickly said to me that I could attend
    a final year and all I had do was to pay the enrolment fee of £90 which I did.</p>

  <p>As time went on, I was still little bitter because I was now studying a degree
    programme in Business and Public Relations that I knew little to nothing
    about. However, I remember having some great teachers such as Keith Thompson,
    Mike Swain, Gwenda whose surname I can’t remember but who’s change
    management skills I’ll never forget, a guy called Chris who failed
    miserably in teaching me and everyone else in the class Prince 2 ha-ha,
    a guy named Keith Tricky that was a guest lecturer (I think) who always
    had something amazing to say about something and countless more. Because
    of these great people at LJMU, I succeed very well in my subject matter,
    so much so that I briefly attained a great internship with Sony in London,
    and not long after, I gained a great job right out of university to work in
    China. Now granted that some people can just do a TESOL course and go to
    China in a matter of weeks, I like to think to myself that I was set aside
    from the rest of the foreigners that were there because as time went on
    I don’t believe anyone’s education or skill came close to mine especially
    when it came to business and PR. This wasn't ignorance in my thought process
    this was my self confindece and belief taking hold.</p>

  <p>While in China, I thought I would only stay for three months but three months
    turned in to four years because I met my wife, 6 years later and 3 kids on
    to hold to my name, I decided to do another course at LJMU but this time
    an MSc in Cyber Security.</p>

  <p>I've always had this massive fascination with science and spending time
    in China really opened my eyes towards programming. I remember my boss
    in China asking me, <em>“Kevin, can you learn Java programming please?”</em>
    and I was like <em>‘no, how do you switch on a computer ha-ha!’</em> (joking aside, I
    know how to switch on a computer), he laughed at the time and said, “go and do
    it because we want to start selling computer course etc” and because I
    was in the business of education and PR I had to know a little on how
    programming worked etc.</p>
  <p>
    So, as time went on, I actually found out that I was pretty good at programming
    or just a very fast learner and that I was probably better at this
    than anything else, but this is to say that I am still very much a
    learner and always will be. I don’t want to give the impression that I am
    some Jedi Master because I’m not and neither is anyone else for that matter.
    Anyway, I started out with an HNC in Computer System and Development,
    my civil qualification in networking such as CCNA (or 3 parts of it) and
    then my MSc in Cybersecurity. Now I’m in discussion for my PhD to study
    HoloBine: Connecting HoloLens and Mobile Devices in Augmented Reality Systems.
    Sounds more significant than what it really is and in some way it might
    be, but I’ve really taken to AR and think it’s fantastic.</p>

  <p>Finally, I should also note too that my time in China is not the only
    place that I have either lived, worked, or visited in my lifetime. I spent
    a significant amount of time within Japan, and also some time visiting
    other countries such as Turkey, US, France, Italy, and Abu-Dhabi but most
    of these other places I’m either passing through and spending little to
    no time there at all really. However, each place I did visit really inspired me
    to be better than what I am now. It was Ketih Thompson who said to me once I switched
    degree programmes,<em>"a degree is like a passport, it opens doors
    to other places, and worlds you might not even consider now."</em>
    I can honeslty say that Keith was one of the best lectueres I've ever had
    and because him, and people like him is why I choose LJMU!</p>

  <p>What you will find from the start of term time and if you go along to the
    freshers fair is a massive amount of information and things about the
    university and the city of Liverpool and what it has to offer. You will
    find small to large businesses offering freebies from drinks to
    pizzas, to pens and paper. Usually you’ll find yourself carrying lots of
    junk quite possibly, stuff that you might not need or just don’t want but
    what you will find is a great social event with lots of lite minded people
    just like yourself wanting to learn and discover so if you take anything
    away from this, go to you freshers fair even if it’s just to see what all
    the fuzz is about.</p>
