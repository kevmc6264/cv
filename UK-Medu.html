  <h1>UK-Medu</h1>

  <p>UK-Medu is like many companies Iâ€™m summoned to assist with. My role here was to
    teach the English Language and off an introduction of Augmented
    Reality Systems that can be applied to the medical profession.</p>

  <p>Pictures are individuals and friends I met along the way who
    work hard and learn much at the Salford Royal Hospital. Everyone
    in these pictures are dedicated to their profession as doctors and surgeons
    who often face stressful and challenging situations while working, observing
    and learning; respect is an understatement.</p>
